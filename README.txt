This mock-up is meant to be a playground for fundamental
architecural aspects of the TRUST OO design.

It does not intendend to reproduce all functionalities of the
original (mighty) TRUST.

The script 'build_mini.sh' can be used to reset the content of 'src' folder to build
a minimal version of TRUST based on the current $TRUST_ROOT_DIR

The 'tools' subdirectory contains various tests/experiments with clang-tidy
